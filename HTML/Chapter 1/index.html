    Remember we start buinding a website by creating a file named index.html
    this tell browser to start execution here as it is the starting point.
    (if we dont use it browser ask what to execute)
    We also use emmet plugin(VS code), it helps in writing html and css
    I will write emmet short cuts at bottom of every code.
